# Coding Challenge
Coding challenge from the Google-Foobar invitation

### Level 2
Very simple problems and soultions.

1) [Salute](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/blob/master/lvl2/salute.py) 
2) [IDs](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/blob/master/lvl2/ids.py)

ids.py, assign ids to bunnies based on a certain pattern appearing in the test data. Real simple.

### Level 3
1) [Makrov Chaining](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/tree/master/lvl3/makrov-chaining): Given a transition matrix of probabilites for changing states between particles, calculate the probability of ending up in a terminal (absorbing) state. Have test files for this problem as well.

2) [Bunny Escape](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/tree/master/lvl3/bunny-escape): Plan an escape for the bunnies given a matrix representing the maze you need to escape. You are allowed to remove at most one wall (or none) and must return the shortest possible path in the matrix. Implemented using dynamic programming with two seperate (but similar) implementations. One using BFS and the other using Bellman-Ford. Have test files for this problem.

3) [Fuel Injector](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/tree/master/lvl3/fuel-injector): Big number arithmetic. How can you divide and work with really large numbers easily? In this case the arithmetic involves addition, subtraction and division of huge numbers ([0, 309] digit range). Solved by working with numbers in their binary representation instead of decimal representation and bitshifting to aquire the same result as decimal arithmetic. 


### Level 4
1) [Bringing A Gun To A Guard Fight](https://github.com/fr3632ho/google_challenge/tree/master/lvl4/guard-fight)
